# ASSET
## Overview
The repository includes the following three folders:
* The folder 'Code' includes the source code of ASSET and all CPDP baselines (DMDAJFR, BurakMHD, CTDP, 3SW-MSTL, and DBN-CP);
* The folder 'Datasets' includes the benchmark datasets used in our paper;
   * Note that each defect dataset is a .arff file, which can be loaded in the MATLAB by calling weka.jar.
* The folder 'Experiemnt Results' includes the detailed experimental results (e.g., performance on each of 200 comninations) of RQ1/2/3/4 and sensitivity analysis;

## Operating Environment: 
* If you want to load the datasets and run ASSET or the baselines, please first meke sure that you have installed MATLAB, [WEKA](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/index.html), and Python in your PC.
* The experimental environment in our paper is: MATLAB R2018b, WEKA 3.8.5, Python 3.6.
